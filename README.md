# Used-Car-Listings
## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze the global used car market to identify which car brands retain their value over time and which factors contribute to depreciation. By examining attributes such as mileage, age, fuel type, transmission, condition, and location, this analysis aims to uncover patterns that influence resale value. The findings can provide insights for buyers seeking cars that hold their value well and for sellers or dealers looking to price vehicles competitively.
